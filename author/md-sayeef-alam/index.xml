      <description>&lt;p&gt;The country-wide lockdown imposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi from March 25, 2020, impaired the lives of many urban migrants who lost their jobs overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all modes of public transport being suspended, urban migrants had no choice but to walk on foot to their native places. P Sainath, veteran development journalist, called it a “gigantic movement in Indian history.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After many cities lurched under its calamitous impact, the novel coronavirus has unearthed a new hunting ground in rural areas. With several migrants returning to their native places, there has been a trend reversal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rural areas of many districts are now reporting an upsurge in the number of confirmed cases of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The World Health Organization’s chief scientist, Soumya Swaminathan, has also expressed her concern, stating that rural India is the next coronavirus hotbed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Assam, Odisha and Jharkhand, that are now witnessing a heavy spike in the number of cases, are the states that have received the highest influx of migrants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rural areas of Rajasthan and Karnataka have also started to record an escalation in the number of cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly 6.7 million migrants returned to 116 districts in six states from urban centres, according to preliminary data compiled by the Union Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of them, about 4.4 million or two-thirds returned to 53 districts. Bihar topped the six states, with 2.36 million migrants returning to 32 districts, followed by Uttar Pradesh, with 1.748 million returning to 31 districts.&lt;/p&gt;
